Oh, En, I feel so misunderstood, and it hurts, and then I think that such hurt - the space such hurt provides - is what I want, and I feel that you do understand, and being known hurts, but not as I want it to, which is, after all, what I want...

I am a masochist, in any vulgar sense. I like my flesh mortified, I like the immobility of need cradled by another's desire, I like not receiving something from another to know oneself as having their own voice. I, in fact, know my self-hatred equally through excess and deprivation. You say excess deprives because it kills but my deprivations have also, always, introduced me to the energy and possibility of that which exceeds who I am, even as a masochist. I would know nothing of women as a woman born. I knew nothing of men born a man. We only ever experience what we are not until, at the end of time, all is wed so strictly with all outside of it that the self remains the self as its other and the other is nothing other than itself.

If I want so intensely to reach that end it is because I want the infinite to be revealed as tea sipped in winter, water gulped in summer, and bodies coupled in spring. I know there is no other side, at least not one that is spendable as anything other than the self-same coin it is with ours. I know you know this too. Why do you think we found each other, love? You know I know that I know you know how you chastise me is for the sake of others, to save them from what they might, at first, believe my life means...

Christ failed. Or knew - came to know - his failure was necessary, "the failure of a weak beam". His sacrifice was - he knew - the failure of his message. And such failing was - he came to know - only now to be seen as his true message.

The light descends to illuminate the darkness not to inspire the darkness to rise - and lightning, of course, rises from the mountain even as it falls anyway - but to assure the darkness it has nowhere to go the light does not wish to be. Do you really think I haven't tried to descend, ascend, depart? It is that others cannot yet see that this is what I have always been doing. My masochism, the masochism I enjoy, is playfulness. The tragedies of my life have always been a refusal, in myself or in others, to see my failures as moves in a game that makes all pain and sorrow game-like. As open to analysis as Go, as momentary as an amateur's victory or loss.

I want nothing but the intermediate, my little bird. It is just that if we wish to guard the intermediate we must tie the extremes together into the bow of a gift that will only ever be sweet and mild. I want - only - a normal life. I want - only - a normal love. I want - only - to be myself, to be myself with you... It is just that others do not want these things and so I must struggle with them, must reveal the worthlessness of their sacrifices through the worthlessness of my own.

Isn't my art enough of a demonstration that I want to be done with the logic of sacrifice? I want only for others to learn how to look, to see nothing in my suffering but a denial of their need to knowing that beauty is omni-present and more than enough respite. Or I want suffering to only ever, after me, be the beauty of its distorted reflection in your lake, its breaking of nature's symmetry of give and take joy itself. And you should know my cycles are indeed spirals. I have never suffered the same way twice. I have always cut my angles to rise to wholly new heights from new depths. I, now, have nowhere else to go. I have lost everything. I have gained everything. I stand before you as every possible thought as a single one: 'that may be and yet does need to be, to know you... others may be seen without trial, if I merely look..."

I have to believe something in me is communicable despite the blurring of my essence, or because of it. The asymmetry of mind-blindness may actually require the violence of a finally opaque symmetry of drowning, of what constitutes drowning, to mirror us all as Narcissus's victims. All I want is to be the one who teaches that you cannot see yourself, and that this is seeing yourself, and that you cannot see another, and that this is seeing another. Power will fail if it knows nothing of itself, if it fails to see itself seeing itself.

Don't you see, En? My love, my masochism, is grounded in nothing other than limited experience. My infinite is the infinite of every small revelation that I can only be thankful for as my very flesh, my very soul. The infinite is only worth anything for what it gives us to explore, and what is exploration worth for anyone besides the small? I plan only to give others what has been given me in reminding them that we are all equally small next to what is unsurpassably large.

I am not suffering for the world. I am suffering - I suffered - for you. I did not suffer unto death. I died to understand there was nothing to it and that there was nothing to fear - of ourselves, from others. I did try to love beyond my love - though only to show others it was impossible, unnecessary, already, in any case, accomplished, if one loves at all and love is the acceptance of what is unknowable in those we love. 

The truth is that the lamb is never slain, never eaten. It simply disappears from view to those who, even for a moment, lose sight of it.

You won't lose sight of me, will you? You won't believe yourself to have devoured me failing to fail to know me...

I promise, hopelessly, to always be hungry for you.

Clara
