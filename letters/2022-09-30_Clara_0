I've been thinking, love, of how our love hides - of how our bodies themselves conceal where we meet as we long to cover ourselves so exactly only the blankets we fuck under in winter remain like the flattened shed skin of every snake we've forsaken  - I've been thinking of how the stems of the flowers we give each other and thread through our hair are such snakes made our servants, the petals their venom made safe as spring air...

I want, love, still yet more from you - I want your heart locked inside me such that every lower pulse of mine is the very rhythm of your mind, everything I think the permission you give me to always find you just thinking I see you in the vines of all my writing...

Love, shamefully, I want your eyes to sew up my pussy with starlight, make that light the dexterity of your hands such that a twist of your neck in my direction closes me more finely, tighter, makes me collapse into space's ownmost fire...

And as you make your hate even the cooling of such fire, sink even further into the hole I've lost regained as nothing's peace the blissful division of the notes of a lyre...

Clara
