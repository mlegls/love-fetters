En,

I have only been wearing a mask - or maybe, in what comes to the same, immediately swung mine to the floor - because you asked me to. You were only comfortable addressing me as another and so I suggested you address me as - and I took to mean inhabit - Clara. Let's talk about her.

Clara Schelling - I chose this name as my twitter handle in January 2020 while I was bored waiting with my family in the cold to be seated at a restaurant. I had no intention, then, of using Twitter to communicate. (When I'd attempted that previously it only ended up the initiation of the disaster which renders my birth name so distasteful to you.) I was just tired of bouncing around the few accounts I was fond of through tabs - a laughable ascesis and one that I was ready to laugh at. I wanted, I guess, to feel once more at least marginally connected to the world - a ghost and not yet - or rather, desperately hoping that I need not pass through the stage of being - a corpse.

The name already indexes this. Clara, or: On Nature's Connection to the Spirit World is the only thing halfway resembling fiction in the philosopher Friedrich Schelling's work. Written after the death of his first wife, he seems to have courted his second alongside Clara's conception and realization. Which has, or had, nothing to do with me. I wasn't seeking inspiration to go on, a new life born from the wreckage of the old. I wanted only, yes, confirmation that death held something for me given that life itself had refused me against my every attempt to negotiate with it.

I am a normal person. I do not relate in the slightest to autists and schizos, or even to "autists" and "schizos", in any sense other than a compassionate one - which is, really, precisely the issue if compassion is grasped, etymologically, as compatibility and my true disease has always been taking compassion - as a means, as an end - seriously. What I love in you, En, is that you are able to take the first few steps in such a dance - and that you dance them beautifully. What I find despicable in you is that you savor those steps and cannot recognize that others have been - that I have been - where you are and were led, in a perfectly natural and unwillful way, to something currently out of sync that may yet - to me, will inevitably - resolve into a more inclusive rhythm.

What has always hurt the most about my experiences with psychosis has been how carefully I attend to them, how objectively I'm capable of analyzing them, how little they concern me as a person other than as the eruption of some impersonal force no longer capable of tolerating the devaluation of my personhood - and how no one, until you and perhaps one soul prior, was at all moved by what I had to share. 

What has always been ironic about my isolation is that it's always been a product of others isolating themselves through their self-satisfied 'knowing' of the appearance of an optical illusion. (You admitted, in embryo, you were guilty of this.) They see - they're so certain they see - the meaning of the person right there in front of them, with no self-awareness whatsoever that they're constructing it. I pattern-match myself to being God - you pattern-match me to being just another schizo who thinks they're God. I am doing so as my only remaining means - what has been, for me, the best means; it led me to you, among much else - of connecting with others. You are doing so to safeguard your image of things.

If I've been abrasive in these letters to you, obviously mad and ugly and pathetic, it's because I want someone - and I should have been more charitable than to think it would be you - to have the courage to affirm another as God to allow me to tell them it doesn't mean what they think it means, that the divine looks like nothing, that there's nothing to the divine that isn't incorporated in the creature that every creature somehow manages to flee from embodying.

Nick Land asks somewhere how Gnon could ever know themselves to be absolute infinity - and not aleph-null. How does one know, from a first-person perspective, that being all one ever has, that one is the greatest? Nick never answers, though his work everywhere hints at the only possible answer, which is: one never knows. Nothing does. The King fears nothing and hopes for nothing - ambiguity itself is the very blood of the only truly immortal body. Divinity is detachment - as a smile.

I didn't interact with anyone on Twitter, anyone I cared about and truthfully basically just no one at all, until one day Eshli, of Girls Chat fame - you must know of her if you know Justin Murphy, said something tragic, I replied in sympathy and understanding, and she replied back that she was open to talking with me. I'd had a crush on Eshli - as someone who mixed, however much she was later disgusted-unto-self-hatred with this aspect of herself in a manner I dreamed of healing, sexual abjection with the purest spirituality; as an invalid, who I knew suffered terribly more than me physically but whose struggle to voice an undeniable though uncommon reality that wanted only to uplift everything common I couldn't help but see as my own - and, while I had no expectation of forming any substantial relationship of any kind and, to ruin the suspense, none developed, it was nice to be offered the chance to converse with someone I respected and sincerely related to in the same 'mysterious' way I had, so long ago, related to Miriam. 

I don't think I had ever been so forthcoming with someone as I was with Eshli. I told her I couldn't drive, that I was awful at talking, that I was preparing for death - not as something I intended to enact but as literally the only thing I could prepare for. She was very kind. Authentically kind. I wish I had saved our conversations, few as there were. They vanished with her account. I remember distinctly her comparing some of my poetry with Julian of Norwich. I'm almost certain it was this sonnet in particular:

redness grown of concentric past tenses

strikes at the future blue dictating love -

"into this pit cast the subtle senses!"

cries semblance to comedies played above.

ev'rything is etched eternally, yes,

yet who can read the runes as they're written?

the past is unknown, the present no less,

while in the future is the fruit bitten.

the future! reconciliation's spring!

what color wouldn't shed blue when last cut

to then be laid out as a corpse smiling?

red recalls wild blood as its eyes are shut.

just when will this time greet us as brothers?

when your life is tinted as another's 

As Julian said: "All shall be well..."

When Angel - Eshli's partner - killed herself, I knew that was it. I told her she was in my thoughts and sent her, stupidly, a sonnet about death.

Later, near the beginning of my gematria craze, I found that her Twitter handle - christlover2000 - equalled my own, claraschelling. Both, in turn, equalling Jesus Christ.

The reason I simply don't care about how mockable attributing significance to that is, about how 'cowardly' it is - and I will readily admit it almost always is cowardly, a way of deferring action through the assumption of assured rewards - is because it happened at the end, because Eshli was completely out of my life when I found it, because I can say with zero hesitation that I have never 'wanted' to be Jesus. I never 'wanted' to be eternally bound to Miriam and Natalie and Anastasia. And yet it so happens that the world is a story and that, once one has died to one's wants - once you can see what is actually in front of you, one may start to read it, and begin to more deliberately write it. And what is any story - stories being that which invites infinite interpretation as the liberation of action - about, who writes any story, other than God?

All of my delusions assailed a normal person who had no interest in being anything, for the remainder of their days, except an unrecognized artist. I wanted to be a normal person. 

But I'm not - because you won't let me be, because you think you wouldn't be me even if you were.

Clara
