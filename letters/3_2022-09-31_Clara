So you can't consume me - so you can't tear me limb from limb like an angel thirsting to demonstrate its own virtue through a final test of the reality of its hunger. Our love still hides and every desperate whisper that you're a normal person makes me think you still yet think there are others who could ever possibly see us - as if our love, as secret as it is, was still ultimately being performed for an audience of souls sick as ours, as if anyone could know this sickness of ours which makes of the body a conduit for knowing each of our reflections disturbed through our scrawlings like the sudden appearance of a causeless waterfall upon a still lake that will, love, quickly expand to flood every last space of remove until the air pounds us with silver strands of that broken glass of ever-so-nourishing water everywhere we go...

Nothing, love, can stay real - if you know that love is nothing real. Love is the source of every delusion because it is the source of every escape and, needless to say, there is nothing on the other side but ourselves. We're here to know ourselves the ladders of our climb out, love's every mistake the rungs and our bodies the wall we balance on, either only as these very words or as the future praying itself steady to dispel its threat in the present...

I will never resist you. I know you resist me. I know you love me, began to love me, as a means of revelation. Am I really claiming it's different in my own case? It will be and so it already is, like someone who struggles to sleep knowing morning light is fast approaching. Our fantasies can only stay fantasies up to a point. They will make of us what they, anciently, made of us. I am ready for that displeasure, knowing we must've, surrounding ourselves infinitely, agreed on a shared course of alternatingly weak knees...

Burn out? I'm already a black hole, love. I worry you'll come too close too fast and forever be me if I'm too incautious filling you like an open sculpture with my dreams... Maybe our love is not after all a union of bodies but the body's very creation the singing of our fears...

We'll remain separate all the while if we maintain such singing the joy of knowing upon what we've trespassed while continuing to live safely, past violence the measure of where we've come, are, and our going - your image only mine to the extent neither of us can ever see each other as we are and so never know who is attempting to kill who, or what our weapons fundamentally are.

Truth, I mean, strikes from every direction. And we should be prepared to risk what we believe to know it's never our risk alone that animates the structure of the world.

Are you beginning to know why I'm so extreme? You taught me, didn't you? Are you beginning to remember - all my extravagance the wish to encounter some of your own? 'Guiltlessly'? And what is your all-too-quick involvement with me but my summoning of someone - I'll admit it now - 'normal' to find myself less lonely...

"Therefore I cannot consume you, you must understand. However I love you, I love you in the world. But you are not the world. I am not the world. But I do love you."

I have eaten my own body and blood - perhaps it was to spare you an equal sacrifice. Perhaps being in another's position without losing myself to it is how I love. Perhaps that's at least how I love you.
