Clara,
 
This is a love letter, but let me give some examples of the pathetic, the ugly, and the despicable. Just to be annoying.

For instance: death, suicide, meaninglessness, oppression, manipulation, confusion, various causes of conflict and heartbreak, irreparable damage and loss - these things are ugly. From the Old Norse "ugga" - to dread. And from the dreaded, one flees.

Such flight is fragile. If it is not a thorough confrontation and resolution, but a vague suppression, perhaps enacted unaware, or more literally a flight, then the ugly thing becomes like a latent parasite. It waits for the right conditions to reawaken; it spreads and develops, asymptomatic, until another vague suppression or flight may no longer be enough to escape the danger again. Sometimes it is not entirely asymptomatic either; little bruises and fevers will show.

Of course, people do not flee from a pure evil, but only from its vessels. Perhaps an idea, but more often an experience - a tragedy, a conflict. I wonder, isn't it trivial and immediate to repair any damage in this superficial way? Pretend it never happened; never mention it again; suppress the thought whenever it arises. It becomes latent, but perhaps we can live so as to never create the conditions for its reactivation. A quick fix - or at least I expect that whenever someone "needs some time", it could not be this kind of repair.

So when someone *does* spend a long time to do a trivial thing like this, that is something pathetic. It's pathetic in the vulgar sense, and also in that it evokes pity and sympathy. A fundamental weakness of character, marking them as other than myself. It makes my gaze dehumanizing. I begin to gaze on them like on a dog, or on the homeless, or how many people gaze on children.

But isn't the hubris that allows me to assume such a sympathy itself something ugly? Because in fact, perhaps most people are like this. The one I pity has more friends and allies than I do. Someone close to both of us is more like them than like me. An ethical standard apart from hegemony becomes nothing more than a niche aesthetic. A trite villain driven by a distorted sense of beauty and value. In this way, I become despicable.

You ask what what I love in you. I thought about it but don't have a faultless answer. For instance, maybe I don't love you especially. I can love many people, and write very significant love letters to still more. Because you were there, it was you. I was not expecting it in prophecy. I was not creating it from ambition.

That is not to say you are not exceptional. For instance, I love that you are exceptionally thorough in your self-presentation. I am bored easily, and somewhat annoyed by repetition. I cannot tolerate superficial cycles for very long, nor pretense that does not continually hint at more. I am quite consumptive. I burn; I destroy what I pass by. I crave ever more substance, ever more of something substantial.  I love that you do not get stuck easily on the things I see many people stuck on. I love that however I burn, there is more substance than ash.

You ask what we are to do about the "others". I think I am crueler than you are willing to assume. I am fine with doing nothing. I am not especially fond of martyrdom, except as an aesthetic in fantasy. Outside of fantasy, martyrdom is merely death. I do not viscerally love the children of the future, the unborn. 

Of course the idea of martyrdom is popular, even among the "others". I am reminded of a scene from the Chinese light novel and anime series *Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation* - already the name evokes that theme, of righteously following the left-hand path - where the brother of the grandmaster of demonic cultivation says to him, with great emotion, something like, "Everybody in the world thinks that what you are doing is evil. If you don't stop, I won't be able to protect you anymore! There is no way you can prevail against the world alone." But the grandmaster does not relent, and indeed is later slain by polite society's combined forces. Well, in a later season he is resurrected by someone's self-sacrificial summoning ritual, but who will do such a thing for you in reality? Or, even if someone does eons later, resurrection is not so literal.

I have often insisted that I am a normal person, because I have found your letters to normal people very beautiful, and sane! You should not think that I am able to understand you better than others do, even if my gaze is especially cruel and piercing, even if my words are especially psychedelic and tempting. These are ugly and despicable qualities, even to myself. Maybe I can bear to become despicable for the sake of the despicable, but only for a little while. I have read your letters to normal people, and I also reject your defense. I am also late to respond. I also pretend to be busy, and do not put you foremost. I also am not fundamentally better than others, or than your wretched self, as if in evidence of the possibility of salvation. Isn't your obsession with gematria also a fragile flight rather than a thorough confrontation? I also consider it a psychosis, and however romanticized and justified, I am not especially fond of psychoses.

Because now in everything you say there is too much meaning. I also believe that there can be too much meaning. For instance, isn't it cruel to *me* to make everything about three women you loved and miss very much? Even to view me as their culmination. Not that I actually mind it viscerally, but what if I were to say so, as an act of manipulation? At least such an attitude prevents me from taking things seriously, or rather, in the same way as you. Surely you understand at least why your fantasy cannot become my own. That's the way in which I'm ultimately a normal person.

But how else might you relate to me? As to your childhood abuser? As to the men you hated, or to the women you feared? I will always respect the boundaries of others, but if you do not establish such boundaries, are you sure you'll never regret however far I go? I also think there is such thing as too much freedom, but somehow I do not restrict myself. Well, it's not like I'm unfamiliar with systems by which the future can justify the past - divination by the I Ching, various heritages of prophecy, even the esoteric allure of the pursuit of pure maths. But practically, these are little more than self-imposed artistic constraints on action and view. What more can an equivalence of numerical sums say than a direct interpretation, other than offering a justification as external and eternal?

I can consider it adorable at best, and more often cowardly. But of course psychotic behaviors are less adorable. I can only think that you have been alone for too long, for such glaring psychoses to persist. And there is that despicable sympathy again - except this time I am on the side of hegemony. For another example, one of the foremost drivers of my word choice is preserving a nice contour to the right margin. It *feels* a little like forming a clay vessel on a potter's wheel, but is unnoticeable unless the final presented typography is identical to that of my workspace. And even in school, typing double-spaced font size 12 Times New Roman directly into Microsoft Word, few noticed. I'm sure it actually makes my writing worse. And I'm sure many other delusions persist much like this, without grave friction against the world. Much like the dreadful kind of latent ugliness.

You say that the "game" is over for me, but you must know that I am not faultless. I spent most of middle and high school under the full sincere expectation that I'd kill myself before age 18. I made myself ugly and despicable in various ways because I greatly disdained everyone around me, but wanted to avoid an attractive presence - that is, a manipulative presence, like a fire to flies. I found myself too easily believed, and thought I ought at least not to be liked. But even today I *enjoy*, for instance, taking strong psychedelics with someone less tolerant than myself, and strongly altering their reality. I enjoy thoroughly entering the realities of schizophrenics, and playing along with various psychoses. You wrote about society's great antagonism toward pedophilia being related to a fear that we are ourselves manipulated, innocent and unaware, by something much more powerful and mature, perhaps like technology. But you must know that I am unrepentently a pedophile and a technologist. How could I not be, while advocating utterly and sincerely for the end of oppression?

But look how I have justified these things again in words, as if to make them beautiful. It almost seems as if I would even advocate for martyrdom now. But you know, the "others" have always been separate from a utopia without oppression. A pedophile is to be hated in mundane society, because a childhood sexual experience with someone more mature than you is an abuse, something ugly and despicable. You *learn* to hate, to fear, to avoid, to justify. To escape from this does not have to be an escape into fantasy, because these are only the conditions of a real place. In Buddhism there is the division of beings into the six realms. In Daoism there are separate realms for common people and sages. There are monasteries, ascetics, and hermits. There is clergy and laity, distinctly separated.

Well, perhaps I can be a sage, but never a savior. I do not intend to destroy everything for you. You are not so important. It cannot be that kind of problem. There are always others. There is always somewhere else. I am not Satan. I am not Job. I am not any character in any myth. I am just here, writing something.

You ask if love isn't liable to disappear if it remains private. It is. That is why it cannot be merely a facet of *your* private fantasy, however distorted to resemble a universal legend. This is why I have always insisted that we are not one Self. No matter what I do, do you really think I can never go too far? Even as I intend to destroy your meaning, and your capacity to mean, will you not establish yourself as something other than a perfect canvas? Perhaps you will manage to convince me that you are not a normal person, but indeed a tabula rasa, or a pristine reflective surface. Even so, I have nothing special to say.
