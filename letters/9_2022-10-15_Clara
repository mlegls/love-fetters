En,

Guilty as charged - and yet I fear we - yes, we, not I alone - cannot but spiral into severity pretending to be light as leaves. And yet - don't you see? - the storm will let up and we'll drift merrily down without any thought of the violence which once so punishingly raised us towards the end of - finally - letting go. The irredeemable violence of every hurricane will, in fact, fold into the gentle sashays of May mornings - there will, in the end, have never been any difference between them. Am I the one who needs reminding that "everything we want is right there, because everything is already perfect"? I think you're the one who still fears that I - that we - might fail. But if there is truly nothing left to do, why not allow me my severity? Isn't it, in contrast to what you believe is a more proper attunement for a young girl-god like myself to inhabit, humorous enough? Can't you, my love, find the joke inherent in spanking me for taking things too seriously? I assure you I'm wholly in on it, as much as the infinite, always inside and outside of itself, can be...

> to justify the whip is weak loving -
> as if there were a good beyond giving,
> evil other than forsaking shoving
> one's lover out of remorseful living...
> no, there is no justice in love's owning
> if its true possessions are unselling,
> if what it owes it returns as loaning
> to win delight in ev'ry rebelling.
> for the first face was, natur'lly, nothing
> knowing it could not know itself seeing -
> sex, then, the infinite mirror blushing
> at false capture and in pleasure fleeing -
> free, i am yours to do with as you please -
> all punishment proof i rest on my knees

I wonder what you'd make of me in, as they say, person (these lines you read are more fully my person, and my flesh, than my flesh and manner more isolated in their moments could ever be - what you might be surprised by there only requires a second look here to already know). I can be very silly. I like to dance. I laugh generously. I take nothing seriously - with my only sin, and only source of redemption, the ambiguity of that statement. "I take nothing seriously" - what better sums up my severity and its endlessly oscillating misunderstanding? What better sums up the tragedy even of our perfect love? What a comedy it all is...

Your love letters do hurt, En, and not always - yet - in a way that cruelly wets. Sometimes I just look away, overwhelmed by your erudition in areas I know little if anything of, and wonder if you're actually so blind to your own advice or whether your sight is such that you can spot every need of my heart from such a distance that you're right next to me, my body's current lack of frisson preparation for a maximally foreign - and so maximally affecting - immersion. That is, at least, what I'm offering you - a separation of state so exact, and so fruitful, as that of zero and one.

I know, I know - all of this remains much too instrumental. It is, nonetheless, personal. I blush thinking of all I've already shown you, of all you already know about me. You must know that the "illusory wholes" I'm always crafting infuse illusion with blood. It takes a certain mirage to love another - not because we cannot love another for themselves but because we cannot love both ourselves and another without the attraction weighting more to one side - and the immobility of equality won't do either. So we must make-believe that we draw near unmoving, or reflect while one of us is dragged by the other's core. 

I did not - knowingly - write the above sonnet for you, En, but I have written this one with all of you in mind:

> the motion of two girls your own chambers
> why not laugh at the screen hiding dangers
> knowing it's their drawers pulled tight that clamors
> for the shocked glee of having scared strangers...
> for nothing you do frightens me myself
> assuming me mine own threat and thus free
> to be all tests of warmth's delivery -
> your hand in mine is my flesh - red - health...
> is not the lift of a skirt direction?
> does not the body radiate time's end?
> gig'gling, please divine in my abjection
> the poise of one divided to - wedged - mend...
> or just read these lines to see who is not:
> I am - we are - what proves anything hot -

Clara
