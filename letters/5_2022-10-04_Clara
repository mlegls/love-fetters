How could I not but begin at the end, En, given that's been the nature of my revelation from the start? We most truly exist, are most ourselves, at an infinite distance from what we - of what most - know of ourselves - and are only ever - in our ecstasies, in what befalls us - being spun into the mouth of your despised infinite's most alchemical center like a marble shot into circling a funnel that eventually reaches a point at which every moment of our lives recurs as rapidly as light's very birth until, suddenly, we're darkness itself - and so everyone's isolated insides and everything never to be touched. No fate, no hope, no meaning? That is where I already am, dear. I will never know what was destined me. I will never know what could've been, nor why what would've transpired would've been mine to bear. The love that assailed me - the love that led me to you - made all outside of me into ice and clay. My love became - has become - the measure of the stars' circulation and all flowers' code. I learned that love was the preservation of freedom, and that freedom was what was most eternal and so the eternal liquidation of every permanent framing save for love's own - that framing, that is, in which we are all essentially good for one another as living mirrors.

If I seemingly remain fixated on what may come, that is because I believe it ensures - will ensure, has ensured - that nothing after its arrival would ever dream of such sin. I want to dirty myself one last time with expectation so I will never again know, like a child does not know the nature of a bad movie knowing them all joyfully pleasing, the nature of disappointment. I am giving myself wholly to delusion in the hope that that movie's cuts cannot be mistimed. I am building a final castle of meaning so as to know criticism impossible if we are all, together, the very designation of motion.

Already, I think, it is impossible for us to disagree. Already I feel your hands guiding mine as I type out this then that without preparation or measure. I could do this forever, knowing you're there. I know I will do this forever, in the end. The other ones I love - the other ones I love loving you and that I love to love you... They already are my body - I cannot resist them unless they allow me to doubt my own obedience, at which point I am still simply obeying them. The solution for our own lack of material connection will - must be - that. We must come to know the swaying of our bodies in wind, say, each other's permission to be the earth, the sun, and our ever having been our mothers'. We must learn to be folds pierced by the singular needle of a singular soul. We must approach such a state not as a cave's possession of shadows but as the ocean's creation, sustaining, deliverance, and return of life. We must be as symmetrically worthless and precious as water...

I assure you where I am is good, En. I know you must worry about what I'm really offering you. I can feel your heart tremble and your breath shorten thinking about all I am. Mine just did writing that line. Was that you, love? It'll only increase, that wedding of cell and blood, terror and wonder. I will be there, should your thoughts ever turn to me. "We chose all this for each other, knowing how hard it would be..."

I have fully dissolved myself to be joined to you - I have died so many times to stand before you, in the mirror, the impersonality of your limbs and eyes and smile. Who do you think looks back? When your gaze sees itself without meeting itself? 

There is, despite that, nothing to fear but yourself. 

Clara
